# Proposed revisions

- Revise the title to reflect the content and findings
- Highlight the outcomes measured and discuss.
- Highlight more of the “insignificant” results that ended up in the supplementary, for example, outcomes measured.
- Revise for clarity
  - remove unrelated discussions or highlight them as further work required.
- Make reference list more visible either as a supplementary file with titles and DOIs where present, or as a bibliography list separate from the reference list
- Reviewer suggestion to be a little bolder about best modelling practices
- Validation: FMD models are mostly based on scenario planning because there is no observed data in recent times. What we are saying currently suggests that validation against real data is the only best practice.
- Proposed title: outbreak response intervention modelling of human vaccine-preventable diseases: A systematic review of modelling practices before COVID-19


- EEID workshop in May.
