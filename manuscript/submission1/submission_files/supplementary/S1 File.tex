\section{Data items}
The following information will be extracted from each of the included studies:
\begin{enumerate}
		\item Disease(s) modelled
		\item Study's main objective(s)
		\item Location studied and whether the first or last author has an affiliation in the location
		\item Model dynamics: deterministic, stochastic, or a hybrid
		\item How individuals are represented in model: individual-bases or compartmental
		\item Whether spatial structure was included
		\item Interventions modelled: vaccination (ring, mass, targeted, prophylactic, pulse) or non-vaccination (movement restrictions, palliative care, quarantine, isolation, treatment, other(s) as indicated)
		\item Model parametrisation (We define model parametrization as the process of obtaining the model's parameter values either from literature or through some kind of mathematical or statistical technique)
		\item Method of model validation with some form of data. (We define model validation as any procedure used to evaluate the model’s suitability for the data and problem being studied)
		\item Outcome measured with model
		\item Authors’ conclusion on the predicted or potential impact of the intervention
		\item Timing of modelling practice: retrospective, real-time, other(s) as indicated
