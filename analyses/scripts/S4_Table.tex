\begin{document}
\maketitle

The following table contains information on the data extracted from each
of the included studies.

Technical note: Due to the large number of rows, the table could not be
printed in one go and was instead printed a few columns at a time. In
actual fact, it is just a repetition of the title column along with the
presented columns.

\hypertarget{table-1}{%
\subsection{Table 1}\label{table-1}}

This section presents extracted data on the author affiliation type
(affiliation\_type), whether it is a purely academic collaboration
(academic\_collab), and the location that was studied.
