# Mechanistic modelling of outbreak response interventions to human vaccine-preventable diseases: a systematic review of modelling practices before COVID-19

This repo contains the data and scripts, and manuscript for a systematic review of differences in modelling practices between academic and mixed modelling groups that developed mechanistic models for evaluating the impact of outbreak response of human vaccine-preventable diseases and foot and mouth disease in livestock during 1970-2019.

A preprint for this systematic review can be found [here](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.27.22275642v1).
